# 🌱 FarmFlow – Greenhouse & Field Management System

**FarmFlow** is a full-stack web app built to help small- and medium-sized farms in Rwanda manage their greenhouse operations. It replaces paper-based tracking with a simple digital system to monitor crops, tasks, harvests, and deliveries — all in one place.

## 🚜 Why It Matters

In Rwanda, many farms still rely on notebooks or WhatsApp to track planting and harvest schedules. FarmFlow helps organize greenhouse operations with a clean, mobile-first dashboard designed specifically for **low-bandwidth environments** and **non-technical users**.
